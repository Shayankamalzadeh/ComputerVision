# ComputerVision
This repository includes computer vision code that recognizes numbers in the sudoku table image and returns the numbers
I use the open cv library and Canny edge for recognizing the borders and using machine learning Library to try to predict the numbers.
 and after that, I implemented the Cany edge method myself and comment Cany edge method which is for open cv, and again run code, to see if both methods worked like each other
